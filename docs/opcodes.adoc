Do we want variable length instructions so that we can have 32 bit values?

Opcode Fields:
  opcode <- bitfield representing an operation
  variable ref <- sequential ID for variables (AnyVal* stored in an array)
  label ref <- sequential ID for labels (index of char in received data)
  type code <- bitfield representing a base type (float or int, represented by one of int literal, float literal, tuple element, head of list, atomic literal, variable, function call & maybe more). Tuples & Lists will be stored in temp variables & constructed into a variable, which is then passed under the "variable" type code to avoid complicating the instruction codes more than neccessary with variable lengths within types.
  value <- raw value for type

Opcodes:
  Create variable of type
  {opcode} {variable ref} {type code}

  Delete variable of type
    Type code is neccessary as tuples need all elems deleting too
  {opcode} {variable ref} {type code}

  Assign to variable
  {opcode} {variable ref} {value type} {value}

  Prepend to list
  {opcode} {variable ref} {value type} {value}

  Section header
    Maybe store as start position in array to be interpreted? (ie variable ref?)
  {opcode} {label ref} {label ref}

  unconditional jump
  {opcode} {label ref} {label ref}

  conditional jump
  {opcode} {value type} {value} {label ref} {label ref}

  function call
  {opcode} {label ref} {argument count} {arguments}* {label ref}
